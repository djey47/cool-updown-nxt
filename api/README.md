Here are the main components behind it:
  - üíö [node](https://nodejs.org/en) v18+
  - üü¶ [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) as main language
  - ‚ö° [vite](https://vitejs.dev) & [vite-plugin-node](https://github.com/axe-me/vite-plugin-node)
  - üêÜ [fastify](https://fastify.dev/) as express alternative
  - üî© [eslint](https://eslint.org) & üÉè [jest](https://jestjs.io) for code quality and reliability.

## Install

Be sure to `cd` into this `api` folder, then issue `npm install`.

## Develop

...with HMR:

`npm run dev`

ESlint is used to lint code during dev server execution.

### Unit tests

- `npm test` will launch Jest
- `npm run test:coverage` will also analyze code coverage.

## Build for production

`npm run build`

ESlint is used to lint code during this build phase.

## Manual linting

To perform manual linting, issue `npm run lint` command.

## Configuration

Default configuration is defined in `api/config/default.json` file.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "port": 3001,
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "diagnosticsIntervalMs": "60000"
  },
  "devices": [{
    "network": {
      "hostname": "my-nas",

### SSH Configuration

Power-off service does require a working communication via SSH; to achieve this, you should check both parts below.

*Note: SSH access to Windows 10+ devices are not officially supported for now.*

#### Client side (instance hosting cool-updown-nxt server)
- Get or generate RSA key pairs
- Connect manually at least once to managed device; to add it to known hosts.

#### Device side, for each of those to be managed
- Allow public key authentication in SSH service parameters
- Add client public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file for the user you wanna connect with.

## Start production server

`npm start`

To run as a service, PM2 is strongly recommended. See https://pm2.keymetrics.io for details.

## HOSTED WEB UI

The integrated web application is available under the `/ui/` path.

For more information, please refer to its own documentation, located under the `<root>/web` path.

## API usage

### GET / (home)

Returns name, version and current context of the server; it is not advised to use context directly to get stats/diags etc. as dedicated services are made for this.

**Sample output**
```json
{
  "package": {
    "name": "cool-updown-nxt-api",
    "version": "1.0.0-alpha"
  },
  "context": {...}
}
```

### GET /logs[?maxNbEvents=<>]

Returns some or all log entries with log file size and entry count.

**Sample output**
```json
{
  "entryCount": 1,
  "logs": [
    {
      "level": "info",
      "message": "incoming request",
      "time": 1698047863548,
      "requestId": "req-3",
      "request": {

}
```

### POST /power-off/[deviceId]

Attempts to shutdownspecified device up through commands sent via SSH.

**Sample output**

This service does not provide any output in nominal case (HTTP code being 204).

## Monitoring cool-updown-nxt server instance

### Logs

To display logs from a terminal, issue following command: `npm run logs`.

Server logs are written to the *api/logs/cool-updown-nxt.log* file and sent to the standard/error outputs as well.


## Processing details: context

Application context, being the whole data required by the application at run-time, has its own processor, to:
- reload persisted context (written to disk) at application start
- regularly update persisted context with the current data, every 1 hour by design.


## Processing details: diagnostics

Diagnostics processor stores the N-1 results in a `previous` field for the device-specific context, and updates current results.

Here are the diagnostics that are actually processed:

### Ping

A `ping` command will be issued to the configured device hostname; 4 ICMP PING packets will be sent.

Diag results:

- `ok` status when the command terminates with success (exit code = 0)
- `ko` status when the command terminates with failure (exit code not 0)
- message attribute is available with the error description caught from error output, if any
- data attribute contains some statistics, such as packet loss, round trip times.

### Power

*Note: By design, the power state of a device is determined by the results of the ping diagnostic above; while working on most cases, that approach might not be 100% reliable, especially when device encounters network issues; besides, there's latency between the real status change and the moment when it comes detected by the diagnostics. So... be aware of the limitations!*

The application actually records the power ON/OFF attempts and thus is able to store:

- date on which the attempt has been made
- reason (source) of this attempt; it can be via api, scheduling, external (e.g power button, supply lost, etc.), or none if no power state change has been detected at all.

At time of every diagnostics processing, it can track the power state change and register external attempts:

- if power state switched from `off` to `on` and last start attempt date is older than 10 minutes (should it be tweakable?), an external start attempt is registered and attempt date is updated to current moment
- if power state switched from `on` to `off` and last stop attempt date is older than 10 minutes (should it be tweakable?), an external stop attempt is registered and attempt date is updated to current moment.

### SSH connectivity

Diagnostics also include asserting the SSH connectivity state, when SSH settings are set into device configuration.

It tries connecting via SSH to issue the `exit` command; this way it can guarantee that service is properly up on the device, user having access, and accepting commands.

Diag results:

- `ok` status when the issued command terminates with success (exit code = 0)
- `ko` status when either SSH connectivity is broken or the command terminates with failure (exit code not 0)
- `n/a` if device SSH parameters are not properly set, or if the current ping diagnostics are ko (meaning it's no use testing SSH connectivity, as the device cannot be found LAN-wise already)
- message attribute is available with the error description caught from error output, if any.

### HTTP test

A GET request is sent to configured URL, when specified. Feature status depends on the HTTP status code:

- `ok` with a status code < 400
- `ko` with a status code >= 400, or any error during HTTP request execution
- `n/a` if device HTTP parameters are not properly set, or if the current ping diagnostics are ko (meaning it's no use testing HTTP, as the device cannot be found LAN-wise already).

## Processing details: statistics

Stats are computed everytime diagnostics processing gets achieved.

For now, uptime has a WIP computation and is in beta state:

- Global: concerning application itself (`current` = from last start, or `overall`  = since the beginning)
- Per configured device (also supporting `current` and `overall` information).
